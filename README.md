# Gym-Landing-Page

It is a simple landing page for the gym management system.

I had created this as a practice project to test my css as well as html knowledge.

By building this landing page I gained some knowledge on how and when to use css float, clear, positioning and display property.

I took help from youtube videos while building this project which helps me to understand how to position elements in a web page along with layout designing of the page.
